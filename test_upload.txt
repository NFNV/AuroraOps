Mindfulness is the practice of bringing one's attention to the present moment, cultivating a sense of awareness and acceptance of thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations. It has been practiced for thousands of years, often rooted in meditation traditions. Modern psychology recognizes mindfulness as an effective technique for reducing stress, enhancing emotional regulation, and improving overall well-being. Regular mindfulness practice can increase focus, reduce anxiety, and promote a sense of calm. Techniques such as deep breathing, body scanning, and mindful walking are commonly used to develop mindfulness skills. Whether practiced in quiet meditation or integrated into daily activities, mindfulness helps individuals navigate the complexities of modern life with greater resilience and clarity.
